Its message is sublime and non -sec-\\ntarian . It deals with the most sacred metaphysi cal science. It im-\\nparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal ques-\\ntions: Who am I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in \\nthis wor d full of dualities  and dilemmas ?  \\nIt's a timeless book of wisdom  that inspired Thoreau, Emerson, \\nEinstein, Oppenheimer, Gandhi and many others. The Bhagavad -\\nGita teaches us how  to equip ourselves  for the battle of life. A re-\\npeated study with faith purifies our psyche and guides us to face \\nthe challenges of modern livin g leading to inner peace and happi-\\nness.  \\nGita teaches the spiritual science of Self -realization  (SR) based \\non the essence of Upanishads and Vedanta. The prime message \\nof the Gita is : The ultimate purpose of life is to realize one’s essen-\\ntial nature and become one with the Supreme Self within  all of us . \\nIt assures spiritual progress for all humans, and ho w to be one with \\nthe Supreme. Its teachings are profound, universal, uplifting, and \\nsublime.  \\nThe ignorance of metaphysical  or Spiritual  knowledge —not \\nknowing our real identity —is humanity’s greatest predicament. It is \\nsaid that there is no human mind that  cannot be purified by a re-\\npeated study of the Gita. Gita explains the basic principles of spir-\\nitual science — using Sanskrit poetry — in a very clear and inspiring \\nmanner. Sacred  relationship between the Creator and the creation  \\nis well established in the G ita. If one lives in the spirit of even a few \\nverses of the Gita, one’s life will be transformed into divinity.  \\nThe philosophy of duty, devotion and Self -knowledge is won-\\nderfully synthesized and harmonized in the Gita —without creating \\nany conflict among t hem—to give the reader eternal bliss, everlast-\\ning peace and perennial joy in life. It awakens Cosmic Conscious-\\nness and stimulates life with spirituality.  Religion tends to create a \\nwall of division and conflicts along religious lines. Whereas, spirit-\\nuality  unites people by breaking those walls. A spiritual person is a \",\n",

Nonviolence or Ahi nsa is one of the most \\nfundamen tal tenets of spiritual culture. All lives, human or non -hu-\\nman, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme \\nLord, Krishna, and His devotee -friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a tem-\\nple, a secluded forest, or on a mountain top ; but on a battlefield on \\nthe eve of a big war. Anyone can be helped by practice of only a few of \\nits teach ings. No change of one’s faith or life -style is needed ! \\nA total of seven hundred (700) verses of the Gita, in 18 chap-\\nters, are recorded in world’s longest  epic, Mah abharata, having \\nover 100,000 verses  in Sanskrit poetry . In Gita Lord Krishna ad-\\nvises Arjuna  to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstand-\\ning of the prin ciples of non-violence  if the background of the war of \\nMahabharata is not kept in mind. Therefore, a brief historical de-\\nscription is in order.  \\n In ancient times there was a king who had t wo sons, Dhri-\\ntarashtra and P andu. The former was born blind; therefore, P andu \\ninherited the kingdom. P andu had five sons. They were called the \\nPandavas. Dhritar ashtra had one hundred sons. They were called \\nthe Kauravas. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravas.  \\n After the death of king P andu, the eldest son of P andu became \\nthe lawful King. Duryodhana was a very jealous person. He also \\nwanted the king dom. The ki ngdom was divided into two halves be-\\ntween the P andavas and the Kauravas.  Duryodhana was not sat-\\nisfied with his share of the king dom. He wanted the entire kingdom \\nfor himself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul pl ays to kill the \\nPandavas and take away  their kingdom  also. He unlawfully took \\npossession of the entire kingdom of the P andavas and refused to \\ngive back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord \\nKrishna and others failed. The big war of Mah abharata was thus \\ninevitable. The P andavas were unwilling par ticipants. They had \\nonly two choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run \\naway from war and accept defeat for the sake of peace and nonvi-\\nolence. Arjuna, one of the five P andava brothers, faced th is di-\\nlemma in the battle field: Whether to fight or run away from war  for \\npeace.  \\n Arjuna’s dilemma is, in reality, the Universal Dilemma. All hu-\\nman beings face dilemmas, big or small, in their everyday life wh ile \\nperforming their duties. Arjuna’s dilemma was a big one. He had to \\nmake a choice between fighting the war and killing his most \\nrevered guru who was on the other side, very dear friends, close \\nrelatives, and many innocent warriors; or run ning away from the ',\n",

The \\nentire seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad -Gita are a discourse \\nbetween Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield \\nnear New Delhi, India, in 3,139 BCE. This discourse was narrated  \\nto the blind king, Dhritar ashtra, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an \\neyewitness war report.  \\n The word ‘Bhagavad’ means the Supreme Being , God  or Bha-\\ngavan in Sanskrit. ‘Gita’ means song. Thus , Bhagavad -Gita means \\nthe Song of God or The Celestial  Song, because it was sung by \\nBhagav an Lord Krishna , an incarnation of God  Himself.  \\n \\nCHAPTER 1  \\n1. Arjuna’s Dilemma  \\nThe blind King inquired  from his charioteer : O Sanjaya, tell me \\nin detail, what did my sons  and the P andavas do in the battlefield \\nbefore the war started? (1.01)  \\nChapter Summary   \\nSanjaya said: Arjuna asked his charioteer -friend, Lord Krishna, \\nto drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see \\nthe arm ies on both sides . Arjuna felt great compas sion to see his \\nfriends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win \\nthis war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and re-\\nfused to fight or do his duty  as a warrior .  \\nArjuna sat down on the back seat of the chariot with his mind \\noverwhelmed with sorrow. ( Verse 1.47)  \\n \\nNOTE : Some non -essential verses from Chapters 1 and 2 only \\nhave been omitted for ease of understanding the teachings of the \\nGita by the first time readers.  \\nCHAPTER 2 \\n2. Spiritual  knowledge  \\nSanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose \\neyes were tearful and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with \\ncompassion and despair.

              " 7: '4                           International Gita Society  \\n \\n The Supreme Lord said: You grieve for those who are not wor-\\nthy of grief; and yet speak words of wisdom. The wise grieve nei-\\nther for the living nor for the dead. (2.11) There was never a time \\nwhen these monarchs, you, or I did not exist, nor shall we ever \\ncease to exist in the future. (2.12) Just as a living being  acquires a \\nchildhood body, a youth body, and an old -age body during this life; \\nsimilarly, it acquires another new body after death. The wise are \\nnot deluded by this. (2.13) The contacts of the senses with the \\nsense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, pain and \\npleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, learn \\nto endure them, O Arjuna, (2.1 4) because a calm person — who is \\nnot afflicted by these sense objects, and is steady in pain and \\npleasure — becomes fit for immortality, O Arjuna. (2.15)  \\nThe spirit is eternal, body is transitory  \\nThe invisible Spirit is eternal, and the visible world , including \\nthe physical body , is transitory. The reality of these two is indeed \\ncertainly seen by the seers of Truth. (2.16) The Spirit by which all \\nthis universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the \\nimperishable Spirit. (2.17) Bodies of the eternal, immutable, and \\nincomprehensible Spirit are perishable. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna. \\n(2.18) One who thinks that Spirit is a slayer, and one who thinks \\nSpirit is slain, are both ignorant. Because Spirit neither slays nor is \\nslain. (2.19) The Spirit i s neither born nor does it die at any time. It \\ndoes not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, \\npermanent, and primeval. The Spirit is not destroyed when the \\nbody is destroyed. (2.20) O Arjuna, how can a person who knows \\nthat the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, kill \\nanyone or cause anyone to be killed? (2.21)  \\nDeath and Reincarnation  of the soul \\nJust as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old \\nones; similarly, the living entity acquires new bodies af ter casting \\naway the old bodies. (2.22) Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire \\ndoes not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not \\nmake it dry. Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wet, or dried. It is eternal, \\nall-pervading, unchanging, immovable, and primeval. (2.23 -24) \\nThe Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and un-\\nchanging. Knowing this Spirit as such, you should not grieve. (2.25)  \\nEven if you think that this living being  takes birth and dies per-\\npetually, even then, O Arjuna, you  should not grieve like this. Be-\\ncause, death is certain for one who is born, and birth is certain for \\none who dies ; and the cycle of birth -death continues . Therefore, \\nyou should not lament over the inevitable. (2.26 -27) All beings, O \\nArjuna, are unmanifest — invisible to our physical eyes — before \\nbirth and after death. They manifest between the birth and the \\ndeath only. What is there to grieve about? (2.28 ) Some look upon ',\n",

Even after hearing about it very few \\npeople know it. (2.29) O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body \\nof all beings is eternally indestructib le. Therefore, you should not \\nmourn for anybody. (2.30)  \\nDuty of a warrior  \\nConsidering also your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. \\nBecause there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a right-\\neous war. (2.31) Only the fortunate warriors, O Arj una, get such an \\nopportunity for a righteous war against evil that is like an open door \\nto heaven. (2.32)  \\nCommentary  \\nThe righteous war is not a religious war against the \\nfollowers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged \\neven against our own evil -doer kith and kin (R igVeda \\n6.75.19). Life is a con tinuous battle between the forces of evil \\nand goodness. “Whosoever kills a n innocent  human being, it shall \\nbe regarded as if he has killed the entire humanity. ” (Surah 5.32).     \\nIt is better to die for a right cause and acquire the grace of \\nsacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates \\nof heaven open wide for those who  stand up to vindicate justice \\nand righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly \\nsupport it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of \\nthe world. The Bible says: Happy are those who suffer persecution \\nbecause they do what God requires. The kingdom of heaven \\nbelongs to them (MATTHEW 5.10). There is no sin in killing an \\naggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an \\naggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically \\naggressors and deserved to be el iminated.  \\nIf you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your \\nduty, lose your reputation, and incur sin. (2.33) People will talk \\nabout your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse \\nthan death. (2.34) The great warriors will thin k that you have re-\\ntreated from the battle out of fear. Those who have greatly es-\\nteemed you will lose respect for you. (2.35) Your enemies will \\nspeak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What \\ncould be more painful to you than this? (2.36) You wi ll go to heaven \\nif killed in the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth \\nif victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Ar-\\njuna. (2.37) Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory \\nand defeat alike, engage yours elf in your duty. By doing your duty \\nthis way, you will not incur sin. (2.38)  \\nImportance of Karma -yoga , the selfless action  \\nThe wisdom of spiritual  knowledge has been imparted to you, \\nO Arjuna. Now listen to the wisdom of Karma -yoga , the selfless ',\n",
              " 9: '6                           International Gita Society  \\n \\n service (Sev a), endowed with which you will free yourself from the \\nbondage  or reactions  of action (Karma). (2.39) In Karma -yoga , no \\neffort is ever lost and there is no adverse effect. Even a little prac-\\ntice of this discipline protects one from the great fear of birth and \\ndeath. (2.40)  A Karma -yogi has a resolute determination for God-\\nrealization, O Arjuna, but the desires of one who works to enjoy the \\nfruits of work are endless. (2.41)  \\nMaterial and spiritual aspects of life  \\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of \\nthe Vedas  or any scripture  — without understanding its real pur-\\npose — think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in it except the \\nrituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42) \\nThey are dominated by material desires and consider the attain-\\nment of heaven as the highest goal of life. The y engage in specific \\nrites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result \\nof their action. (2.43) The resolute determination of Self -realization \\nis not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure \\nand power and whose judgment is obscured by such ritualistic ac-\\ntivities. (2.44) A portion of the Vedas deals with three modes or \\nstates of the material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites; \\nbe ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition \\nand preservation. Rise  above the three states, and be Self -con-\\nscious, O Arjuna. (2.45) To a Self -realized person, scripture s are \\nas useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge \\nlake becomes available. (2.46)  \\nTheory and practice of Karma -yoga \\nYou have control o ver your respective duty only, but no control \\nor claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your only \\nmotive  and y ou should never be inactive. (2.47) Do your duty to \\nthe best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached to the \\nLord, aba ndoning worry and attachment  to the results, and remain-\\ning calm in both success and failure. The calmness of mind  is \\ncalled Karma -yoga . (2.48) Work done with selfish motives is infe-\\nrior by far to selfless service or Karma -yoga . Therefore, be a \\nKarma -yogi, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of \\ntheir labor are, in truth, unhappy. Because , one has no control over \\nthe results. (2.49)  \\nA true Karma -yogi becomes free from both vice and virtue in \\nthis very life. Therefore, strive for Karma -yoga . Working to the best \\nof one’s abilities without becoming attached to the fruits of work is \\ncalled Karma -yoga . (2.50) Wise Karma -yogis are freed from the \\nbondage of rebirth by renouncing attachment to the fruits of all \\nwork and attain a blissful divine sta te. (2.51) When your intellect \\ncompletely pierces the veil of confusion, then you will become in-\\ndifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the \\nscriptures. (2.52)  ',\n",

(2.53) Arjuna said: O Krishna, \\nwhat are the marks of an enlightened person whose intellect is  \\nsteady? How does a person of steady intellect speak? How does \\nsuch a person sit and walk? (2.54)  \\nMarks of a Self -realized person  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: When one is completely free from all \\ndesires of the mind and is satisfied with the Eternal Being ( God) by \\nthe joy of Eternal Being, then one is called an enlightened person, \\nO Arjuna. (2.55) A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, \\nwho does not crave pleasures  — and who is completely free from \\nattachment, fear, and anger — is called a sage of steady mind. \\n(2.56) Those who are not attached to anything, who are neither \\nelated by getting desired results, nor troubled by undesired results, \\ntheir intellect is considered steady. (2.57) When one can com-\\npletely withdraw the senses from its sense objects — as a tortoise \\nwithdraws its limbs into the shell for protection  from dangers — then \\nthe intellect of such a person is considered steady. (2.58) The de-\\nsire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense \\nenjoyment, but the craving for sense enjoyment remains. The  crav-\\ning also disappears from one who has known the Supreme Being. \\n(2.59)  \\nDangers of unrestrained senses  \\nRestless senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of \\neven a wise person striving for perfection. (2.60) One should fix \\none’s mind on Me with lov ing contemplation after bringing the \\nsenses under control. One’s intellect becomes steady when one’s \\nsenses are under complete control. (2.61) One develops attach-\\nment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for \\nsense objects comes from att achment to sense objects, and anger \\ncomes from unfulfilled desires. (2.62) Delusion or wild ideas arise \\nfrom anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion. Reasoning is de-\\nstroyed when the mind is bewildered. One falls from the right path \\nwhen reasoning is dest royed. (2.63)  \\nPeace through sense control and Self -knowledge  \\nA disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that \\nare under control and free from likes and dislikes, attains tranquil-\\nity. (2.64) All sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquil ity. \\nThe intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes completely \\nsteady and united with the Source . (2.65) There is neither Self -\\nknowledge nor Self -perception to those who are not united with the \\nEternal Being. Without Self -perception there is no peace , and with-\\nout peace there can be no happiness. (2.66)  ',\n",
              " 11: '8                           International Gita Society  \\n \\n The mind, when controlled by roving senses, steals away the \\nintellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destina-\\ntion — the spiritual shore. (2.67) Therefore, O Arjuna, one’s intel-\\nlect becomes steady when the senses are completely withdrawn \\nfrom its sense objects. (2.68) A yogi, the person of self -restraint, \\nremains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for a yogi \\nwho sees when all othe rs are wakeful. (2.69)   \\nNOTE: W hat is considered real by a yogi is of no value for \\na worldly person  and vice -versa . \\n \\nOne attains peace when all desires dissipate within the mind \\nwithout creating any mental disturbance, just as river waters enter \\nthe full o cean without creating any disturbance. One who desires \\nmaterial objects is never peaceful. (2.70) One who abandons all \\ndesires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of “ i” and \\n“my”, attains peace. (2.71) O Arjuna, this is the superconscious \\nstate of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded. Gain-\\ning this state, even at the end of one’s life, a person attains Nirv ana \\n(or becomes one with the Absolute). (2.72)  \\nCHAPTER 3 \\n3. Path of Selfless service, Karma -yoga  \\nArjuna said: If You consider acquiring spiritual  knowledge is \\nbetter than working, then why do You want me to engage in this \\nhorrible war, O Krishna? You seem to confuse my mind by appar-\\nently conflicting words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I \\nmay attain the Supreme. (3.01 -02) The Supreme Lord said: In this \\nworld, O Arjuna, a twofold path of spiritual discipline has been \\nstated by Me in the past — the path of Self -knowledge for the con-\\ntemplative,  introverts  and the path of unselfish work (Sev a, Karma-\\nyoga ) for all others . (3.03) One does not attain freedom from the \\nbondage of Karma by merely abstaining from work. No one attains \\nperfection by merely giving up work. (3.04) Because no one can \\nremain actionless even for a moment, everyone is driven to a ction \\n— helplessly indeed — by the forces of nature. (3.05) The deluded \\nones, who restrain their organs of action but mentally dwell upon \\nthe sense enjoyment, are called hypocrites. (3.06)  \\nWhy one should serve others?  \\nOne who controls the senses by a trained and purified mind \\nand intellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service, \\nis superior, O Arjuna. (3.07) Perform your obligatory duty because \\nworking is indeed better than sitting idle. Even the maintena nce of \\nyour body would be impossible without work. (3.08) Human beings  \\nare bound by work that is not performed as a selfless service. \\nTherefore, O Arjuna, becoming free from attachment  to the fruits \\nof work, do your duty efficiently as a service to Me.

One who enjoys the gift of celestial s without \\noffering them anything in return is, indeed, a thief.

(3.14 -15) One who does not help to keep \\nthe wheel of creation in motion by sacrificial duty and who rejoices \\nsense pleasures  only, that sinful person lives in vain, O Arjuna. \\n(3.16) For a Self -realized person, who rejoices only with God, who \\nis delighted with God and who is content with God, there is no duty. \\n(3.17)  Such a person has no interest, whatsoever, in what is done \\nor what is not done. A Self -realized person does not depend o n \\nanybody , except God, for anything.  (3.18)  \\nLeaders should set an example  \\nTherefore, always perform your duty efficiently and without any \\nattachment  to the results, because by doing work without attach-\\nment one attains the Supreme Being. (3.19) King Janaka  and oth-\\ners attained perfection (or Self -realization) by selfless service \\n(Karma -yoga ) alone. You should also perform your duty with a view \\nto guide people, and for universal welfare of the society. (3.20) \\nWhatever noble persons do, others follow. Whatever standard they \\nset up, the world follows. (3.21) O Arjuna, there is nothing in the \\nthree worlds (heaven, earth, and the lower regions) that should be \\ndone by Me, nor there is anything that I should obtain, yet I engage \\nin action. (3.22) If I do not engage in action relentlessly, O Arjuna, \\npeople would follow My path. These worlds would perish if I do not \\nwork, and I would be the cause of confusion and destruction of all \\nthese people. (3.23 -24) As the ignoran t work, O Arjuna, with at-\\ntachment to the fruits of work, so the wise should work without at-\\ntachment, for the welfare of the society.

(3.26)  \\nAll works are the works of Nature  \\nAll work is done by the energy and power of nature, but due to \\ndelusion of ignorance, people assume themselves to be the doer  \\nand thus incu r sin or Karmic bondage . (3.27) One who knows the \\ntruth, O Arjuna, about the role of the forces of nature and work, \\ndoes not become attached to work, knowing very well that it ’s the \\nforces of nature that work with their instruments — our organs. \\n(3.28) Tho se who are deluded by the illusive power (M aya) of Na-\\nture become attached to the work done by the forces of nature. \\nThe wise should not disturb the mind of the ignorant whose \\nknowledge is imperfect. (3.29) Do your duty — dedicating all work \\nto Me — in a sp iritual frame of mind, free from desire, attachment, \\nand mental grief. (3.30) Those who always practice this teaching \\nof Mine — with faith , sincerity and free from c omplain  — are freed \\nfrom the bondage of Karma. But those who carp at My teaching \\nand do not practice it, should be considered ignorant of all \\nknowledge, senseless, and lost. (3.31 -32) All beings follow their \\nnature. Even the wise act according to their own nature . What, \\nthen, is the value of sense restraint? (3.33)   \\nTwo stumbling blocks on the path  \\nLikes and dislikes for sense objects remain in the senses. One \\nshould not come under the control of these two , because they are, \\nindeed, two major stumbling blocks on one’s path of Self -realiza-\\ntion. (3.34) One’s inferior natural work is better than superior un-\\nnatural work. Death in carrying out one’s natural work is useful. \\nUnnatural work produces too much stress. (3.35)  \\nLust is the origin of sin  \\nArjuna said: O Krishna , what impels one to commit sin as if \\nunwillingly and forced against one’s will? (3.36) The Supreme Lord \\nsaid: It is lust (or intense desire for material and sensual pleas-\\nures), born out of passion, that becomes anger when unfulfilled. \\nLust is insatiable a nd is a great devil. Know this as the enemy. \\n(3.37) As the fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as \\nan embryo by the amnion, similarly Self -knowledge becomes ob-\\nscured by lust. (3.38) O Arjuna, Self -knowledge becomes covered \\nby this insatiable fire of lust, the eternal enemy of the wise. (3.39) \\nThe senses, the mind, and the intellect are said to be the seat of \\nlust. Lust — by controlling the senses, the mind, and the intellect \\n— deludes a person by veiling Self -knowledge. (3.40) Therefore, \\nO Arj una, by controlling the senses first, kill this devil of material \\ndesire that destroys Self -knowledge and Self -realization. (3.41)  \\nHow to control lust  \\nThe senses are said to be superior to the body; the mind is \\nsuperior to the senses; the intellect is sup erior to the mind; and ',\n",

(3.42) Thus, knowing the Spirit to \\nbe superior to the intellect, and controlling the mind by the intellect \\nthat is purified by spiritual practices, one must kill this mighty en-\\nemy, lust, O Arjuna.  (3.43)  \\nCHAPTER 4 \\n4. Path of renunciation with Self-knowledge  \\nKarma -yoga  is an ancient law  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: I taught this Karma -yoga , the eternal \\nscience of selfless  action, to King Vivasv an. Vivasv an taught it to \\nManu. Manu taught it to Ikshv aku. Thus handed down in succes-\\nsion the saintly Kings knew this . After a long time the science of \\nKarma -yoga  was lost from this earth. Today I have described the \\nsame ancient science to you because you are my sincere devotee \\nand friend. Karma -yoga  is the supreme secret indeed. (4.01 -03) \\nArjuna said: You were born later, but Vivasv an was born in ancient \\ntime. How am I to understand that You taught this Karma -yoga  in \\nthe beginning of the creation? (4.04)  \\nThe purpose of incarnation of God \\nThe Supreme Lord sa id: Both you and I have taken many \\nbirths. I remember them all, O Arjuna, but you do not remember. \\n(4.05) Though I am eternal, immutable, and the Lord of all beings, \\nyet I manifest myself by controlling My own material Nature, using \\nMy divine potential ene rgy (M aya). (4.06) Whenever there is a de-\\ncline of Dharma (Righteousness) and a predominance of Adharma \\n(or Unrighteousness), O Arjuna, then I manifest Myself. I appear \\nfrom time to time for protecting the good, for transforming the \\nwicked, and for establis hing world order (Dharma). (4.07 -08) The \\none who truly understands My transcendental appearance and ac-\\ntivities of creation, maintenance, and dissolution, attains My su-\\npreme abode and is not born again after leaving this body, O Ar-\\njuna. (4.09) Many have bec ome free from attachment, fear, anger, \\nand attained salvation by taking refuge in Me, becoming fully ab-\\nsorbed in My thoughts, and becoming purified by the fire of Self -\\nknowledge. (4.10)  \\nPath of worship and prayer  \\nWith whatever motive people worship Me, I fulfill their desires \\naccordingly. People worship Me with different motives. (4.11) \\nThose who long for success in their work here on the earth worship \\nthe celestial controllers. Success in work comes quickly in this hu-\\nman world. (4.12) The four divisions — based on aptitude and vo-\\ncation — of human society were created by Me. Though I am the \\nauthor of this system of the division of labor, one should know that \\nI do nothing and I am eternal. (4.13) Work or Karma does not bind \\nMe, because I have no desire for t he fruits of work. The one who \\nfully understands and practices this truth is also not bound by \\nKarma. (4.14) The ancient seekers of liberation also performed ',\n",

(4.1 5) \\nAttached, detached, and forbidden action  \\nEven the wise ones are confused about what is action and what \\nis inaction. Therefore, I shall clearly explain what is action, knowing \\nthat one shall be liberated from the evil of birth and death. (4.16) \\nThe true nature of action is very difficult to understand. Therefore, \\none should know the nature of attached or selfish action, the nature \\nof detached or selfless action, and also the nature of forbidden ac-\\ntion. (4.17)  \\nA Karma -yogi is not subject  to the K armic laws  \\nThe one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is \\na wise person. Such a person is a yogi and has accomplished eve-\\nrything. (4.18)  \\nTo see inaction in action and vice versa is to understand that \\nthe Lord does  all the work indirectly through His power by using us. \\nHe is the inactive actor. We are actively inactive , because we can-\\nnot do anything without the flow of His power. Therefore, we are \\nnot the doer, just an instrument in His hands.   \\nA person, whose desir es have become selfless by being \\nroasted in the fire of Self -knowledge, is called a sage by the wise. \\n(4.19) The one who has abandoned attachment to the fruits of \\nwork, and remains ever content and dependent on no one but God, \\nsuch a person — though engaged in activity — does nothing at all \\nand incurs no K armic reaction, good or bad. (4.20) The one who is \\nfree from desires, whose mind and senses are under control, and \\nwho has renounced all proprietorship, does not incur sin — the \\nKarmic reaction — by doing bodily action. (4.21) Content with \\nwhatever gain comes naturally by His will, unaffected by pairs of \\nopposites, free from envy, calm in success and failure, though en-\\ngaged in work, such a Karma -yogi is not bound by Karma. (4.22) \\nThe one who is free f rom attachment, whose mind is fixed in Self -\\nknowledge, who does work as a service (Sev a) to the Lord, all K ar-\\nmic bonds of such a philanthropic person ( Karma -yogi) dissolve \\naway. (4.23) God shall be realized by the one who considers eve-\\nrything as a manifest ation or an act of God. (Also see 9.16) (4.24)  \\nDifferent types of spiritual practices  \\nSome yogis perform the service of worship to celestial control-\\nlers (Devas, guardian angels), while others study scriptures for \\nSelf-knowledge. Some restrain their sense s and give up their sen-\\nsual pleasures. Others perform breathing and other yogic exer-\\ncises. Some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice. (4.25 -',\n",

All these people are the knowers of sac-\\nrifice, and are pu rified by their sacrifice. (4.30) Those who perform \\nselfless service obtain the nectar of Self -knowledge as a result of \\ntheir sacrifice and attain the Eternal Being. O Arjuna, even this \\nworld is not a happy place for the non -sacrificer, how can the other \\nworld be? (4.31) Many types of spiritual disciplines are described \\nin the Vedas. Know them all to be born from Karma or the action \\nof body, mind, and senses. Knowing this, you shall attain  Nirvana. \\n(4.32)  \\nA superior spiritual practice  \\nThe acquisition and propagation of Self -knowledge are supe-\\nrior to any material gain or gift, O Arjuna. Because all actions in \\ntheir entirety culminate in knowledge. (4.33) Acquire this spiritual  \\nknowledge from a Self -realized guru by humble reverence, by sin-\\ncere inquiry, and by service. The wise ones who have realized the \\nTruth will teach you. (4.34) After knowing the Truth, O Arjuna, you \\nshall not again become deluded like this. By this knowledge you \\nshall behold the entire cre ation first within Me, the Supreme Being, \\nthen within your own higher self and then see Me alone in every-\\nthing. (4.35) Even if one is the most sinful of all sinners, one shall \\nyet cross over the ocean of sin by the raft of Self -knowledge. (4.36) \\nAs the bla zing fire reduces wood to ashes; similarly, the fire of Self -\\nknowledge reduces all bonds of Karma  (or sin)  to ashes, O Arjuna. \\n(4.37)  \\nSpiritual  knowledge is revealed to a Karma -yogi \\nIn truth, there is no purifier in this world like the true knowledge \\nof the Supreme Being. One who becomes purified by Karma -yoga  \\ndiscovers this knowledge within, naturally, in due course of time. \\n(4.38) The one who has faith and is sincere in yogic practi ces and \\nhas control over the senses, gains this spiritual  knowledge. Having \\ngained this knowledge, one at once attains supreme peace. (4.39) \\nThe irrational, the faithless, and the atheist perish. There is neither \\nthis world, nor the world beyond, nor happi ness for the disbeliever. \\n(4.40)  \\nKnowledge , Karma -yoga  are needed for Nirv ana \\nWork (Karma) does not bind a person who has renounced work \\nby renouncing attachment  to the fruits of work, and whose doubts \\nabout the Self are completely destroyed by Self -knowledge, O Ar-\\njuna. (4.41) Therefore, cut the ignorance -born doubt about the Su-\\npreme Being abiding in your mind by the sword of Self -knowledge, \\nresort to Karma -yoga , and get up for the war, O Arjuna.

Path of meditation  \\nA Karma -yogi is also a renunciant  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: One who performs the prescribed duty \\nwithout seeking its fruit only for personal enjoyment , is a renunciant \\n(Samny asi) and a Karma -yogi. One does not become Samny asi \\nmerely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become a yogi \\nmerely by abstaining from work.

(6.02)  \\nA definition of yoga and yogi  \\nFor the wise who seeks to attain yoga of meditation or calm-\\nness of mind, Karma -yoga  is said to be the means. For the one \\nwho has attained yoga, the calmness becomes the means of Self -\\nrealization. A person is said to have attained yogic perfection when  \\none has no desire fo r sensual pleasures or attachment to the fruits \\nof work, and has renounced all selfish motives  behind any action . \\n(6.03 -04) \\nMind is both a friend and an enemy  \\nOne must elevate — and not degrade — oneself by one’s own \\nmind. The mind alone is one’s friend as well as one’s enemy. The \\nmind is the friend of those who have control over it, and the same \\nmind acts like an enemy for those who do not control it. (6.05 -06) \\nOne who has control over the lower self — the mind and senses \\n— is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor \\nand dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme Self. \\n(6.07) A person is called yogi who has both Self -knowledge and  \\nSelf-realization, who is calm, who has control over the mind and \\nsenses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same. (6.08) \\nA person is considered superior who is impartial towards compan-\\nions, friends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relative s, saints, \\nand sinners. (6.09)  \\nTechniques of meditation  \\nA yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to \\ncontemplate the Supreme Being after bringing the mind and \\nsenses under control, and becoming free from desires and propri-\\netorship. (6.10 ) One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is \\nneither too high nor too low, covered with dry grass, a deerskin, \\nand a cloth, one over the other, in a clean spot. Sitting there in a \\ncomfortable position and concentrating the mind on God, control-\\nling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should prac-\\ntice meditation for self -purification. (6.11 -12) One should sit by \\nholding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless \\nand steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily in front of th e nos-\\ntrils, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless; \\npractice celibacy; have the mind under control; think of Me; and ',\n",

(6.13 -14)  Thus, by always practic-\\ning to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind is  subdued \\nattains peace of Nirv ana and comes to Me. (6.15)  \\nThis yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too \\nmuch or who does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or who keeps \\nawake. (6.16) But for the one who is moderate in eating, recreation, \\nworking, sleeping, and waking, the yoga of meditation destroys all \\nsorrow. (6.17) A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union \\nwith the Eternal Being, when the perfectly disciplined mind be-\\ncomes free from all desires and gets completely united with God in \\nSamadhi (trance). (6.18) A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Eternal \\nBeing from the wind of desires does not flicker; this simile is used \\nfor the subdued mind of a yogi, practicing meditation on the Eternal \\nBeing. (6.19)  \\nWhen the mind, disciplined by t he practice of meditation, be-\\ncomes steady, one becomes content with the Eternal Being by be-\\nholding Him with purified intellect. (6.20) One feels infinite bliss that \\nis perceivable only through the intellect and is beyond the reach of \\nthe senses. After real izing the Eternal Being, one is never sepa-\\nrated from the Absolute Reality. (6.21) After Self -realization (SR), \\none does not regard any other gain superior to SR. Established in \\nSR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22) The \\nstate of severan ce of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga \\nshould be practiced with firm determination and without any mental \\nreservation. (6.23) One gradually attains tranquility of mind by to-\\ntally abandoning all selfish desires, completely restraining the \\nsenses from the sense objects by the intellect, keeping the mind \\nfully absorbed in the Eternal Being by means of a well -trained and \\npurified intellect, and thinking of Me. (6.24 -25) Wheresoever this \\nrestless and unsteady mind wanders away during meditation, one \\nshould just witness it under the supervision of the Self. (6.26)  \\nWho is a yogi?  \\nSupreme bliss comes to a Self -realized yogi, whose mind is \\ntranquil, whose desires are under control, and who is free from sin \\n(or faults). (6.27) Such a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his \\nor her mind and intellect with the Eternal Being, easily enjoys the \\ninfinite bliss of contact with  God. (6.28) Because of perceiving the \\nomnipresent  Eternal Being abiding in all beings, and all beings \\nabiding in the Eternal Being; a yogi, who is in union with the Eternal \\nBeing, sees every being with an equal eye. (6.29) Those who per-\\nceive Me in everything and behold everything in Me, are not sepa-\\nrated  from Me, and I am not separated from them. (6.30) The non -\\ndualists, who adore Me as abiding in all beings, abide in Me irre-\\nspective of their mode of living. (6.31) One is considered the best \\nyogi who regards every being like oneself and who can feel the \\npain and pleasures of others as one’s own, O Arjuna. (6.32)  ',\n",

I \\nam the sweet fragrance in the earth. I am the heat in the fire, the \\nlife in all living beings, and the austerity in the ascetics.

(7.10 -11) Know that three modes (Gunas) of \\nNature — goodness, passion, and ignorance — also emanate from \\nMe. I am not dependent on or affected  by the Gunas, but the Gunas \\nare dependent on Me.

One who is \\nsteadfast becomes one with Me and abides in My supreme abode. \\n(7.18) After many births the enlightened one resorts to Me by real-\\nizing that everything is, indeed, My manifestation.

Endowed with steady faith, they worship that deity and \\nfulfil their wishes through that deity. Those wishes are, indeed , \\ngranted only by Me. (7.21 -22) Such material gains of these less \\nintelligent human beings are temporary. The worshipers of celes-\\ntial controllers go to celestial controllers, but My devotees certainly \\ncome to Me. (7.23)  \\nThe ignorant ones — unable to under stand My immutable, in-\\ncomparable, incomprehensible and transcendental form , assume \\nthat I am formless and take form  just as  humans do .

(8.05) Remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the \\nend of life, one attains that object, O Arjuna . Because of the con-\\nstant thought of that object , one remembers that object at the end \\nof life and achieves it.

(8.09 -10) I \\nshall briefly explain the process to attain the supreme abode that \\nthe knowers of the Veda call immutable; into which the ascetics, \\nfreed from attachment, enter; and desiring which, people lead a life \\nof celibacy.

(8.15) The dwellers of all the worlds — up to \\nand including the world of Brahm a, the creator — are subject to the \\nmiseries of repeated birth and death. But, after attaining Me, O Ar-\\njuna, one does not take birth agai n. (8.16)  \\nEverything in the creation is cyclic  \\nThose who know that the day of the creator (Brahm a) lasts one \\nthousand Yugas (or 4.32 billion solar years) and that his night also \\nlasts one thousand Yugas, they are the knowers of day and night. \\n(8.17) All manifestations come out of the primary material Nature \\n(Adi-Prakriti) at the arrival of the day of Brahm a, the Creative \\nPower, and they again merge into the same at the coming of \\nBrahm a’s night. (8.18) The same multitude of beings comes into \\nexistence agai n and again at the arrival of the day of the creator \\n(Brahm a); and are annihilated, inevitably, at the arrival of Brahm a’s \\nnight. (8.19)  \\nThere is another eternal existence — higher than the changea-\\nble material Nature (Prakriti) — that does not perish when  all cre-\\nated beings perish. This is called the Eternal Being. This is also \\nsaid to be the supreme abode. Those who attain My supreme \\nabode do not take birth again. (8.20 -21) This supreme abode, O \\nArjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Me, within w hich all \\nbeings exist and by which all this universe is pervaded. (8.22)  \\nTwo basic paths of departure  after death  \\nO Arjuna, now I shall describe different paths departing by \\nwhich, after death, the yogis do or do not come back. (8.23) Pass-\\ning gradually, a fter death, through celestial controllers of fire, light, \\ndaytime, the bright lunar fortnight, and the six months of the north-\\nern solstice of the sun, yogis who know the Self attain supreme \\nabode and do not come back to earth. (8.24) Passing gradually, \\nafter death, through celestial controllers of smoke, night, the dark \\nlunar fortnight, and the six months of southern solstice of the sun, \\nthe righteous person at tains heaven and comes back to earth \\nagain. (8.25) The path of light of Self -knowledge and the pa th of \\ndarkness of ignorance are thought to be the world’s two eternal \\npaths. The former leads to salvation (Mukti, Nirv ana), and the latter \\nleads to rebirth. (8.26)  \\n \\n \\n \\nSpiritual  knowledge leads to salvation  \\nKnowing these two paths, O Arjuna, a yogi is not bewildered at \\nall. Therefore, O Arjuna, be steadfast in yoga  (union)  with Me at all \\ntimes.

(9.03) This entire \\nuniverse is an expansion of Mine. All beings depend on Me. I do \\nnot depend on them , because I am the highest of all.

(9.08) These acts of creation do not bind \\nMe, O Arjuna, because I remain indifferent and unattached to those \\nacts. (9.09) The divine kinetic energy  (Maya) — with the help of \\nmaterial Nature — creates all animate and inanimate objects under \\nMy supervision; thus, the creation keeps on going, O Arjuna. (9.10)  \\nThe ways of the wise and of the ignorant  \\nIgnorant persons hate Me when I appear in human form be-\\ncause they do not know My spiritual  nature as the great Lord of all \\nbeings and take Me for an ordinary human . They have false hopes, \\nfalse actions, false knowledge, and delusive qualities (See 16.04 -\\n18) of fiends and demons and are unable to recognize Me . (9.11 -\\n12) But great souls, O Arjuna, who possess divine qualities (See \\n16.01 -03), know Me as immutable, as both the material and effi-\\ncient cause of creation, and worship Me single -mindedly with lov-\\ning devotion.

(9.22) O Arjuna, even those \\ndevotees who worship the deities with faith, they also worship Me, \\nbut in an improper way.

One who knows the cre-\\nation is called the creator by the seers of truth. (13.01) O Arjuna, \\nknow Me to be the creator of all the creation. The true understand-\\ning of both the creator and the creation is conside red by Me to be \\nthe spiritual  or metaphysical knowledge. (13.02 ) What the creation \\nis, what it ’s like, what its transformations are, where its source is, \\nwho that creator is, and what His powers are — hear all these from \\nMe in brief. (13.03) The seers have  separately described the crea-\\ntion and the creator in different ways in the Vedic hymns, and also \\nin the conclusive and convincing verses of the Brahma -Sutra. \\n(13.04) The primary material Nature, cosmic intellect, \"I\" con-\\nsciousness or ego, five basic eleme nts, ten organs, mind, five \\nsense objects; and desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the physical \\nbody, consciousness, and resolve — thus the entire field has been \\nbriefly described with its transformations.

That which is contrary to \\nthis is ignorance. (13.09 -11) \\nGod can be described by parables only \\nI shall fully describe the object of knowledge — knowing which \\none attains immortality. The beginningless Supreme Being is said \\nto be neither eternal (Sat) nor temporal (Asat). (13.12) The Eternal \\nBeing has His hands, feet, eyes, head, mouth, and ears every-\\nwhere , because He is all -pervading and omnipresent. (13.13) He \\nis the perceiver of all sense objects without the physical sense or-\\ngans; unattached, and yet the sustainer of all; devoid of three \\nmodes of material Nature, and yet the enj oyer of the modes of ma-\\nterial Nature by becoming a living entity. (13.14) He is inside as \\nwell as outside all beings, animate and inanimate. He is incompre-\\nhensible because of His subtlety. And because of His omnipres-\\nence, He is very near , residing in one’s  inner psyche , as well as far \\naway in His Supreme Abode. (13.15) He is undivided, and yet ap-\\npears to exist as if divided in beings. He, the object of knowledge, ',\n",

Understanding \\nthis, My devotee attains the supreme abode. (13.18)  \\nA description of  the supreme spirit, spirit, and jiva \\nKnow that both  the material Nature and the Spiritual Being are \\nbeginningless. All manifestations and three states of mind and mat-\\nter, called modes or Gunas, are born of Prakriti. Prakriti is said to \\nbe the cause of production of the physical body and the eleven \\norgans o f perception and action. Purusha (Consciousness, Spirit) \\nis said to be the cause of experiencing pleasure and pain. (13.19 -\\n20) Purusha enjoys three modes of material Nature (Prakriti) by \\nassociating with Prakriti. Attachment to the Gunas due to igno-\\nrance c aused by previous Karma is the cause of birth of living entity  \\n(jiva)  in good and evil wombs. (13.21)  \\nEternal Being ( God, Spirit) in the body is also called the witness, \\nthe guide, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord, and also the \\nSupreme Self. (13.22) They who truly understand Spiritual Being \\n(Purusha) and the material Nature (Prakriti) with its three modes \\n(Gunas) a re not born again, regardless of their way of life. (13.23) \\nSome perceive the supersoul in their inner psyche through mind \\nand intellect that have been purified either by meditation or by met-\\naphysical knowledge or by Karma -yoga . (13.24)  \\nThe faith alone ca n lead to Nirvana \\nOthers, however, do not know the yoga of meditation, \\nknowledge, and work; but they perform deity worship with faith, as \\nmentioned in the scriptures by the saints and sages. They also \\ntranscend death by virtue of their firm faith in what t hey have heard. \\n(13.25) Whatever is born, animate or inanimate, know them to be \\nborn from the union of the matter and Spirit, O Arjuna. (13.26)  \\nThe one who sees the same eternal Supreme Lord dwelling as \\nSpirit equally within all mortal beings, truly sees.  (13.27)  Because \\nof beholding one and the same Lord existing equally in every be-\\ning, one does not injure anybody and thereupon attains the su-\\npreme abode. (13.28) One who perceives that all works are done \\nby the powers (Gunas) of material Nature (Prakriti) alone, and thus \\ndoes not consider oneself as the doer, that person truly under-\\nstands. (13.29) The moment one discovers the diverse variety of \\nbeings and their ideas abiding in the Source  and coming out from \\nHim alone, one attains the Supreme Being.

(14.02)  \\nBeings  are born from the union of spirit and matter  \\nMy material Nature is the womb of creation wherein I place the \\nseed of consciousness from which all beings are born, O Arjuna. \\n(14.03) Whatever forms are produced in all different wombs, O Ar-\\njuna, the material Nature is their body -giving mother; and I am t he \\nlife-giving father. (14.04)  \\nHow three modes of material nature bind us \\nSattva or goodness; Rajas or passion, activity; and Tamas or \\nignorance, inertia — these three modes (Ropes, Gunas) of mate-\\nrial Nature (Prakriti) fetter the eternal individual soul to the body, O \\nArjuna. (14.05) Of these, the mode of goodness is illuminatin g and \\ngood because it is pure. It fetters the living entity by attachment to \\nhappiness and knowledge, O sinless Arjuna. (14.06) Know that the \\nmode of passion is characterized by intense craving and is the \\nsource of desire and attachment. It binds the livin g entity by attach-\\nment to the fruits of work. (14.07) Know, O Arjuna, that the mode \\nof ignorance — the deluder of living entity — is born of inertia. It \\nbinds the living entity by carelessness, laziness, and excessive \\nsleep. (14.08) O Arjuna, the mode of g oodness attaches one to \\nhappiness (of learning and knowing the Eternal Being); the mode \\nof passion attaches to intense action; and the mode of ignorance \\nattaches to inaction, laziness  by covering Self -knowledge.

(14.13)  \\nThree modes are also the vehicles of transmigration  \\nOne who dies when goodness dominates goes to heaven — \\nthe pure world of knowers of the Supreme. (14.14) One who dies \\nwhen passion dominates is reb orn attached to action or the utilitar-\\nian type. One who dies in ignorance is reborn as a lower creature. \\n(14.15) The fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure; \\nthe fruit of passionate action is pain; and the fruit of ignorant action \\nis lazines s. (14.16) Self -knowledge arises from the mode of good-\\nness; greed arises from the mode of passion; and negligence, de-\\nlusion, and slowness of mind arise from the mode of ignorance. \\n(14.17) They who are established in goodness go to heaven; pas-\\nsionate person s are reborn in the mortal world; and the ignorant, \\nabiding in the lowest mode of ignorance, go to lower planets or hell \\n(or take birth as lower creatures).

(14.19)  When  \\none rises above the three modes of material Nature that originate \\nin the body, one attains immortality or salvation (Mukti) and is freed \\nfrom the pains of birth, old age, and death. (14.20)  \\nThe process of rising above three modes  \\nArjuna said: What are the  marks of those who have trans-\\ncended the three modes of material Nature, and what is their con-\\nduct? How does one transcend these three modes of material Na-\\nture, O Lord Krishna? (14.21) The Supreme Lord said: One is said \\nto have transcended the modes of mat erial Nature who neither \\nhates the presence of enlightenment, activity, and delusion; nor \\ndesires for them when they are absent; who remains like a witness \\nwithout being affected by the modes of material Nature; who stays \\nfirmly attached to the Lord withou t wavering — thinking that only \\nthe modes of material Nature are operating.

The world is caused by sexual \\nunion of man and woman alone and nothing else. (16.08) Adhering \\nto this wrong, atheistic view, these degraded souls — with small \\nintellect and cruel deeds — are born as enemies for the destruction \\nof the world. (16.09) Filled with insatiable desires, hypocrisy, pride, \\nand arrogance; holding wrong views due to delusion; they act with \\nimpure motives, (16.10) obsessed with endless anxiety lasting until \\ndeath, considering sense gratification their highe st aim, and con-\\nvinced that sense pleasure is everything; (16.11)  \\nBound by hundreds of ties of desire and enslaved by lust and \\nanger, they strive to obtain wealth by unlawful means to fulfill sen-\\nsual pleasures.

Threefold faith  \\nArjuna said: What is the mode of devotion of those who perform \\nspiritual practices with faith, but without following the scriptural in-\\njunctions, O Krishna? Is it in the mode of goodness, passion, or \\nignorance? (17.01)  \\nThree types of faith  \\nThe Supreme Lord  said: The natural faith of embodied beings \\nis of three kinds: Goodness, passion, and ignorance. Now hear \\nabout these from Me. (17.02) O Arjuna, the faith of each is in ac-\\ncordance with one’s own natural disposition governed by K armic \\nimpressions. One is kn own by one’s faith. One can become what-\\never one wants to be — if one constantly contemplates the object \\nof desire with faith.

(17.05 -06) \\nThree types of food  \\nThe food preferred by all of us is also of three types. So are the \\nsacrifice, a usterity, and charity. Now hear the distinction between ',\n",

(17.07) The foods that promote longevity, virtue, strength, \\nhealth, happiness, and joy are juicy, smooth, substantial, and nu-\\ntritious. Such foods are liked by persons in the mode of goodness. \\n(17.08) People in the mode of passion like foods that are very bit-\\nter, sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry, and burning; and cause pain, \\ngrief, and disease. (17.09) People in the mode of ignorance like \\nfoods that are stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, refuse, impu re, such \\nas meat and alcohol. (17.10)  \\nThree types of sacrifices  \\nSelfless service  — enjoined by the scriptures and performed \\nwithout a desire for the fruit, with a firm belief and conviction that it \\nis one’s  duty — is in the mode of goodness. (17.11) Selfless ser-\\nvice that is performed only for show and aiming for fruit  — is in the \\nmode of passion, O Arjuna. (17.12) Selfless service that is per-\\nformed without following the scripture, in which no food is distrib-\\nuted, which is devoid of mantra, faith, and gift, is said to be in the \\nmode of ignorance. (17.13)  \\nAusterity of thought, word, and deed  \\nThe worship of celestial controllers, the priest , the guru, and \\nthe wise; purity, honesty, celibacy, and nonviolence — these are \\nsaid to be austerity of deed. (17.14) Speech that is non -offensive, \\ntruthful, pleasant, beneficial, and is used for the regular study of \\nscriptures is called the austerity of word. (17.15) Serenity of mind, \\ngentleness, calmness, self -control, and purity of thought — these \\nare called austerity of thought. (17.16)  \\nThree types of austerity  \\nThe above mentioned threefold austerity — of thought, word, \\nand deed  — practiced by yogis w ith supreme faith, without a desire \\nfor the fruit, is said to be in the mode of goodness. (17.17) Austerity \\nthat is performed for gaining respect, honor, reverence, and for the \\nsake of show, yielding an uncertain and temporary result, is said to \\nbe in the mode of passion. (17.18) Austerity performed with foolish \\nstubbornness or with self -torture or for harming others, is said to \\nbe in the mode of ignorance. (17.19)  \\nThree types of charity  \\nCharity that is given at the right place and time as a matter of \\nduty to a deserving candidate who does nothing in return, is con-\\nsidered to be in the mode of goodness. (17.20) Charity that is given \\nunwillingly, or to get something in return, or to gain some fruit, is \\nsaid to be in the mode of passion. (17.21) Charity that is  given at a \\nwrong place and time to unworthy persons, or without paying re-\\nspect to the receiver or with ridicule, is said to be in the mode of \\nignorance. (17.22)  \\nThreefold name of God \\n‘OM TAT SAT’ is said to be the threefold name of God in San-\\nskrit. Persons with good qualities, the Vedas, and selfless service ',\n",
              " 45: \"42                           International Gita Society  \\n \\n were created by God in the ancient time. (17.23) Therefore, acts of \\nsacrifice, charity, and austerity prescribed in the scriptures are al-\\nways commenced by uttering ‘OM’ by the knowe rs of the Supreme \\nBeing. (17.24) Various types of sacrifice, charity, and austerity are \\nperformed by the seekers of salvation by uttering ‘TAT’ (or He is \\nall) without seeking a reward. (17.25) The word ‘SAT’ is used in the \\nsense of Reality and goodness. Th e word ‘SAT’ is also used for an \\nauspicious act, O Arjuna. (17.26) Faith in sacrifice, charity, and \\nausterity is also called ‘SAT’. Selfless service for the sake of the \\nSupreme is, in truth, termed as ‘SAT’. (17.27) Whatever is done \\nwithout faith — whether  it is sacrifice, charity, austerity, or any \\nother act — is called ‘ASAT’. It has no value here or hereafter, O \\nArjuna. (17.28)  \\nCHAPTER 18  \\n18. Attaining liberation by giving up ego  \\nArjuna said: I wish to know the nature of renunciation \\n(Samny asa) and sacri fice ( Tyaga) and the difference between the \\ntwo, O Lord Krishna. (18.01)  \\nDefinition of renunciation and sacrifice  \\nThe Supreme Lord said: The sages call renunciation the com-\\nplete renunciation of work for any personal profit. The wise define \\nsacrifice as the sacrifice of, and the freedom from, attachment  to \\nthe fruits of all work. (18.02) Some philosophers say that all work \\nis full of faults and should be gi ven up, while others say that acts \\nof sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned. \\n(18.03)  \\nO Arjuna, listen to My conclusion about sacrifice. Sacrifice is \\nsaid to be of three types. (18.04) Acts of service, charity, and aus-\\nterity should not be abandoned, but should be performed , because \\nservice, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the wise. (18.05) \\nEven these obligatory works should be performed without attach-\\nment to the fruits. This is My definite supreme advice, O Arjuna.  \\n(18.06)  \\nThree types of sacrifice  \\nGiving up one's duty is not proper. The abandonment of oblig-\\natory work is due to delusion and is declared to be in the mode of \\nignorance. (18.07) One who abandons duty merely because it is \\ndifficult or because of fear of bodily affliction, does not get the ben-\\nefits of sacrifice by performing such a sacrifice in the mode of pas-\\nsion. (18.08) Obligatory work performed as duty, renouncing at-\\ntachment to the fruit, is alone to be regarded as sacrifice in the \\nmode of goodness, O Arjuna. (18.09) One who neither hates a dis-\\nagreeable work, nor is attached to an agreeable work, is consid-\\nered a sacrificer (Ty agi), imbued with the mode of goodness, intel-\\nligent, and free from all doubts about the Supreme Being. (18.10) \\nHuman beings canno t completely abstain from work. Therefore, \",\n",
              " 46: '                    Bhagavad -Gita                             43 \\n \\n one who completely renounces attachment to the fruits of all work \\nis considered a Ty agi. (18.11) The threefold fruit of works — desir-\\nable, undesirable, and mixed — accrues after death to the one who \\nis not a Ty agi, but never to a Ty agi. (18.12)  \\nFive causes of an action  \\nLearn from Me, O Arjuna, the five causes, as described in the \\nSamkhya doctrine, for the accomplishment of all actions. They are: \\nthe physical body, the seat of Karma; the modes of material Na-\\nture, the doer; the eleven organs of perception and action, the in-\\nstruments; various life forces; and the fifth is one’s fate. (18.13-14) \\nThese are the five causes of whatever action, whether right or \\nwrong, one performs by thought, word and deed. (18.15) There-\\nfore, the ignorant, who consider one’s body or the soul as the sole \\nagent, do not understand due to imperfect knowledge. (18 .16) One \\nwho is free from the notion of doership and whose intellect is not \\npolluted by the desire to reap the fruit — even after slaying all these \\npeople — neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. (18.17) \\nThe subject, the object, and the knowledg e of the object are the \\nthreefold driving force (or impetus) to an action. The eleven organs \\nof perception and action, the act, and the modes of Nature are the \\nthree components of action. (18.18)  \\nThree types of spiritual knowledge  \\nSelf-knowledge, action, a nd agent are said to be of three types, \\naccording to the Guna theory. Hear duly about these also. (18.19) \\nThe knowledge by which one sees a single immutable Reality in all \\nbeings as undivided in the divided, such knowledge is in the mode \\nof goodness. (18.2 0) The knowledge by which one sees different \\nrealities of various types among all beings as separate from one \\nanother; such knowledge is in the mode of passion. (18.21) The \\nirrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings \\nto one single eff ect, such as the body , as if it is everything, such \\nknowledge is declared to be in the mode of darkness o r ignorance \\n(18.22)  \\nThree types of action  \\nObligatory duty, performed without likes and dislikes and with-\\nout selfish motives and attachment to enjoy the  fruit, is said to be \\nin the mode of goodness. (18.23) Action performed with ego, with \\nselfish motives, and with too much effort, is in the mode of passion. \\n(18.24) Action that is undertaken because of delusion, disregard-\\ning consequences, loss, injury to o thers, as well as one’s own abil-\\nity, is said to be in the mode of ignorance. (18.25)  \\nThree types of person  \\nA person  who is free from attachment, is non -egotistic, en-\\ndowed with resolve and enthusiasm, and unperturbed in success \\nor failure, is called good. (18.26) A person  who is impassioned, \\nwho desires the fruits of work, who is greedy, violent, impure, and ',\n",
              " 47: '44                           International Gita Society  \\n \\n gets affect ed by joy and sorrow, is called passionate. (18.27) A \\nperson  who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, wicked, malicious, \\nlazy, depressed, and procrastinating, is called  ignorant. (18.28)  \\nThree types of intellect  \\nNow hear Me explain fully and separately, O A rjuna, the three-\\nfold division of intellect and resolve, based on modes of material \\nNature. (18.29) O Arjuna, that intellect is in the mode of goodness \\nwhich understands the path of work and the path of renunciation, \\nright and wrong action, fear and fearles sness, bondage and liber-\\nation. (18.30) That intellect is in the mode of passion which cannot \\ndistinguish between righteousness and unrighteousness, and right \\nand wrong action, O Arjuna. (18.31) That intellect is in the mode of \\nignorance which, when covered  by ignorance, accepts unright-\\neousness as righteousness and thinks everything to be that which \\nit is not, O Arjuna. (18.32)  \\nThree types of resolve, four goals of human life  \\nThat resolve is in the mode of goodness by which one manip-\\nulates the functions of the mind, Pr ana (bioimpulses, life forces) \\nand senses for God-realization only, O Arjuna. (18.33) That resolve \\nis in the mode of passion by which one, craving for the fruits of \\nwork, clings to duty, earning wealth, and pleasure  with great at-\\ntachment. (18.3 4) That resolve is in the mode of ignorance by \\nwhich a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despair, and \\ncarelessness, O Arjuna. (18.35)  \\nThree types of pleasure  \\nAnd now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. \\nThe pleasure that one  enjoys from spiritual practice results in ces-\\nsation of all sorrows. (18.36) The pleasure that appears as poison \\nin the beginning, but is like nectar in the end, comes by the grace \\nof Self -knowledge and is in the mode of goodness. (18.37) Sensual \\npleasures  that appear as nectars in the beginning, but become poi-\\nson in the end, are in the mode of passion. (18.38) Pleasure that \\nconfuses a person in the beginning and in the end as a result of \\nsleep, laziness, and carelessness, is in the mode of ignorance. \\n(18.3 9) There is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial \\ncontrollers in the heaven, who can remain free from these three \\nmodes of material Nature. (18.40)  \\nDivision of labor is based on one’s ability  \\nThe division of labor into four categories  is also based on the \\nqualities inherent in people’s nature and not necessarily as one’s \\nbirth right, O Arjuna. (18.41) Intellectuals who have serenity, self -\\ncontrol, austerity, purity, patience, honesty, spiritual  knowledge, \\nspiritual  experience , and belief in God are labeled as intellectuals \\n(Brahmans ). (18.42) Those having the qualities of heroism, vigor, \\nfirmness, dexterity, steadfastness in battle, charity, and adminis-\\ntrative skills are called Kshatriyas or warriors.

Those who are very good in \\nservice and labor type work are classed as laborers . (18.44)  \\nAttain salvation by duty, discipline, devotion  \\nOne can attain the highest perfection by devotion to one’s nat-\\nural work. Listen to Me how one attains perfection while engaged \\nin one’s natural work. (18.45) One attains perfection by worship-\\nping the Supreme Being —from whom all beings originate, and by \\nwhom all this universe is pervaded — through performance of \\none’s natural duty for Him. (18.46) One’s inferior natural work is \\nbetter than superior unnatural work even though well performed. \\nOne who does the work ordained by one’s inherent nature without \\nselfish motives incurs no sin or K armic bondage . (18.47) One’s \\nnatural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned be-\\ncause all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered \\nby smoke, O Arjuna. (18.48) The person whose mind is always free \\nfrom attachment , who has subdued the mind and  senses, and who \\nis free from desires, attains the supreme perfection of freedom \\nfrom the bondage of Karma by renouncing attachment  to the fruits \\nof work. (18.49)  \\nLearn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such \\nperfection — the freedom from  the bondage of Karma  — attains \\nthe Supreme Person, the goal of spiritual  knowledge. (18.50) En-\\ndowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, \\nturning away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving \\nup likes and dislikes; living  in solitude; eating lightly; controlling the \\nmind, speech, and organs of action; ever absorbed in yoga of med-\\nitation; taking refuge in detachment; and relinquishing egotism, vi-\\nolence, pride, lust, anger, and proprietorship — one becomes \\npeaceful, free fro m the notion of \"I” and “my\", and fit for attaining \\noneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51 -53) Absorbed in the Su-\\npreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires. Becom-\\ning impartial to all beings, one obtains My Par a-Bhakti, the highest \\ndevotional l ove. (18.54) By devotion one truly understands what \\nand who I am in essence. Having known Me in essence, one im-\\nmediately merges with Me. (18.55)  \\nA Karma -yogi attains the eternal immutable abode, by My grace \\n— even while doing all duties — just by dedicating  all action to Me \\nwith loving devotion. (18.56) Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set \\nMe as your supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always \\nfix your mind on Me and resort to Karma -yoga . (18.57) When your \\nmind becomes fixed on Me, you shal l overcome all difficulties by \\nMy grace. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall per-\\nish. (18.58)  \\nKarmic bondage and the free will  ',\n",

(18.59) O Ar-\\njuna, you are controlled by your own nature -born K armic impres-\\nsions (or Samsk ara). Therefore, you shall do — even against your \\nwill — what you do not wish to do out of delusion. (18.60) The Su-\\npreme Lord, Krishna  or God, abiding as the contr oller in the inner \\npsyche of all beings, O Arjuna, causes them to evolve  — or work \\nout their Karma  — like a puppet of Karma , mounted on a machine. \\n(18.61)  \\n  The Supreme Controller is the reflection of the Supreme \\nSpirit  in the body. The Supreme Lord organizes, controls, \\nsupervises, and directs everything in the universe. Human being  is \\nlike a puppet of Karma mounted on a body which is the vehicle of \\ntransmigr ation. The word evolve refers to working out one’s Karma. \\nThus we become the puppet of our own Karma created by our free \\nwill.  \\n The Lord has made Karmic laws as the controller of all \\nliving beings. Therefore, one must learn to gladly endure all that \\nfate imposes by taking refuge in God and following His \\ncommandments. Vedas declare that the Lord, using His law of \\nKarma, makes us dance as a juggler would make his mon key \\ndance. Without the laws of Karma ; the scriptural in junctions, \\nprohibitions, as well as self-effort, would have no value at all. \\nKarma is the eternal justice and the eternal law. As a result of the \\nworking of eternal justice, there can be no escape from the con -\\nsequences of our deeds. We become the product of our own past \\nthink ing and action . Therefore, we must think and act wisely at the \\npresent moment, using the scriptures as a guide.  \\n The doctrine of Karma and reincarnation is also found in \\nthe following two verses of the Koran: Allah is He who cre ated you \\nand then sustained you, then ca uses you to die, then gives life to \\nyou again ( Surah  30.40). He may reward those who believe and \\ndo good works. No one is able to escape His law of consequences \\n(Surah  30.45).  People cannot escape from the consequences of \\ntheir deeds, for as we sow, so we reap. Cause and effect cannot \\nbe separated because the effect exists in the cause as the fruit \\nexists in the seed. Good and evil deeds follow us continually like \\nour shadows.  \\n The Bible also says: Whosoever shedeth man’s blood, by \\nman shall his blood be shed (Genesis 9.06). It is believed that all \\nreferences to Karma and reincarnation were taken out of the Bible \\nduring the second century with the noble aim of encouraging \\npeople  to strive hard for perfection during this very life. Those who \\nbelieve in reincarnation must avoid laziness and procrastination, \\nstress intense spiritual discipline, and try their best to get Self -',\n",

One cannot achieve \\nanything through laziness and procras tination.  \\nSeek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O \\nArjuna. By His grace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eter-\\nnal Abode. (18.62) Thus, I have explained the knowledge that is \\nmore secret than the secret. After fully reflecting on this, do as you \\nwish. (18.63)  \\nPath of surrender is the ultimate path to God \\nHear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very \\ndear to Me; therefore, I shall tell this for your benefit. (18.64) Fix \\nyour mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down \\nto Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you , because \\nyou are My very dear friend. (18.65) Setting aside doership,  own-\\nership and attachment to the fruits of all works, just surrender to —\\nor gladly abide by — My Will. I shall liberate you from all sins or \\nbondage of Karma. Do not grieve. (18.66)  \\nThe meaning of abandoning all duties and taking refuge in \\nGod is that one should perform duty without ego and attachment  \\nto results ; as an offering to the Lord, and totally depend only on \\nHim. The Lord takes full responsibility for a person who totally de-\\npends on Him  and understands : All is manifestation of the One .  \\nThe highest service to God, and the best charity  \\nThis knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is \\ndevoid of austerity, who is without devotion, who does not desire \\nto listen, or  who speaks ill of Me. (18.67)  \\nTo speak of wisdom to a deluded person, to glorify sacrifice to \\na greedy person, to advise sense control to an irascible person, \\nand to discourse on Lord Rama’s exploits to a lecher, is as useless \\nas sow ing seed on barren ground . It is not for any soul to believe, \\nsave by the pe rmission of Allah. You should not compel one to \\nbelieve ( Surah  10.100 -101). Anyone to whom Allah  has not \\ngranted the light (of knowledge) will have no light ( Surah  24.40).  \\nThe study of Gita  or any other scripture  is meant only for sincere \\npersons. Accordin g to Ramakrishna, one can understand Him as \\nmuch as He makes one un derstand. Guru Nanak said: O Beloved; \\nonly they to whom You give the divine knowledge, obtain it.  \\nThe one who shall propagate (or help the propagation of) this \\nsupreme secret philosophy of the Gita amongst devotees, shall be \\nperforming the highest devotional service to Me and shall certainly \\ncome to Me. (18.68) No other person shall do a more pleasing ser-\\nvice to Me, and no one on the earth shall be dear er to Me. (18.69)  \\nThe Grace of the Gita  \\nThose who shall study our sacred dialogue shall be performing \\na holy act of knowledge -sacrifice. This is My promise. (18.70) Who-\\never hears or reads this sacred dialogue in the form of the Gita with ',\n",

Has your delusion born of ignorance been completely de-\\nstroyed? (18.72) Arjuna said: By Your Grace my delusion is de-\\nstroyed; I have gained Self -knowledge; my confusion with regard \\nto body and Spirit  is dispelled; and I shall obey Your command. \\n(18.73)  \\nSanjaya said: Thus, I heard this wonderful dialogue between \\nLord Krishna and  Arjuna, causing my h air to stand on end. (18.74) \\nBy the grace of guru sage Vy asa, I heard this most secret and su-\\npreme yoga directly from Krishna, the Lord of yoga, Himself speak-\\ning to Arjuna before my very eyes of clairvoyance granted by sage \\nVyasa. (18.75)  O King, by repeat ed remembrance of this marvel-\\nous and sacred dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, I am \\nthrilled at every moment, and (18.76) recollecting again and again, \\nO King, that marvelous form of Krishna I am greatly amazed, and \\nI rejoice over and over again. (1 8.77)  \\nBoth spiritual knowledge and action are needed  \\nWherever there will be both Krishna, the Lord of yoga (or \\nDharma in the form of the scriptures) and Arjuna with the weapons \\nof duty and protection, there will be everlasting prosperity, victory, \\nhappine ss, and morality. This is my conviction.

The \\nentire seven hundred verses of the Bhagavad -Gita are a discourse \\nbetween Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield \\nnear New Delhi, India, in 3,139 BCE. This discourse was narrated  \\nto the blind king, Dhritar ashtra, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an \\neyewitness war report.  \\n The word ‘Bhagavad’ means the Supreme Being , God  or Bha-\\ngavan in Sanskrit. ‘Gita’ means song. Thus , Bhagavad -Gita means \\nthe Song of God or The Celestial  Song, because it was sung by \\nBhagav an Lord Krishna , an incarnation of God  Himself.  \\n \\nCHAPTER 1  \\n1. Arjuna’s Dilemma  \\nThe blind King inquired  from his charioteer : O Sanjaya, tell me \\nin detail, what did my sons  and the P andavas do in the battlefield \\nbefore the war started? (1.01)  \\nChapter Summary   \\nSanjaya said: Arjuna asked his charioteer -friend, Lord Krishna, \\nto drive his chariot between the two armies so that he could see \\nthe arm ies on both sides . Arjuna felt great compas sion to see his \\nfriends and relatives on the opposite side, whom he must kill to win \\nthis war. He became confused, spoke of the evils of war, and re-\\nfused to fight or do his duty  as a warrior .  \\nArjuna sat down on the back seat of the chariot with his mind \\noverwhelmed with sorrow. ( Verse 1.47)  \\n \\nNOTE : Some non -essential verses from Chapters 1 and 2 only \\nhave been omitted for ease of understanding the teachings of the \\nGita by the first time readers.  \\nCHAPTER 2 \\n2.
